              From Software's Soulsborne series has become a synonym with
              crueling difficulty. While these games are (most of the time) fair
              and their reputation has been HUGELY exaggerated, no doubt they
              still are hard as nails. Especially in the beginning! These games
              don't hold your hand or tell you about the crucial mechanics which
              would make your journey that much easier. So here is a small guide
              for each of the games, telling you the very basic tips and tricks
              for a smoother start! This guide isn't for people who want a
              step-by-step guide through the early game but for those who wish
              to actually figure out the game on their own, while finding it a
              little bit overwhelming or intimidating!

            Demon's Souls was maybe the game that started it all, but this is
            the game that made the genre widely known.

          <h4 class="my-4">General tips:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            You will die a lot. But don't let that discourage you. It is part of
            the learning experience. In Dark Souls when you kill something you
            get <em><u>souls</u></em> and when you die, you turn into a hollow
            and drop your <strong>souls</strong>. You get only one chance to get
            back to the point of your death and collect them back. And you
            definetly want to, souls are the game's form of currency, used to
            level up your character, shop items etc.
            <br />
            Bonfires are your friend. They heal you up, you can use them to
            level up, they refill your healing Estus Flasks and so on. But keep
            in mind, they also respawn every enemy.

          <p class="lead my-4">
            Choosing a character class is totally up to you. You will be able to
            change your build by leveling up later. Starting gift is also up to
            you. (Just... don't take binoculars.) Master Key is a double edged
            sword. It allows you to access certain later areas and good loot
            very early on. It also lets you skip certain hard areas. However as
            a beginner it might get you lost really bad.

            The dark sheep of the family. The only one not directed by the
            father of the series, Hidetaka Miyazaki. Lot has changed since the
            first game. While no doubt flawed, this game brought new great
            elements (such as powerstancing weapons) to the series and the PVP
            is considered to be superior compared to other games by many.

          <p class="lead my-4">
            Killing enemies yield souls (currency used for level upping,
            shopping etc.). However when you die you drop the souls. You get
            only one chance to get back to that point and collect them back or
            they'll be lost forever. Also your max health drops every time you
            die. When you are hollow you are hollow you are unable to summon
            NPCs or other players for help. Unlike in the first game, this time
            it won't prevent others from incading you!
