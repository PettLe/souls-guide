              From Software's Soulsborne series has become a synonym with
              crueling difficulty. While these games are (most of the time) fair
              and their reputation has been HUGELY exaggerated, no doubt they
              still are hard as nails. Especially in the beginning! These games
              don't hold your hand or tell you about the crucial mechanics which
              would make your journey that much easier. So here is a small guide
              for each of the games, telling you the very basic tips and tricks
              for a smoother start! This guide isn't for people who want a
              step-by-step guide through the early game but for those who wish
              to actually figure out the game on their own, while finding it a
              little bit overwhelming or intimidating!

            <u>World Tendency:</u> <br />One of the more unique mechanics of the
            game is World Tendency. It can shift towards white or black
            depending on your actions. Good deeds such banishing black phantoms,
            killing bosses etc. shift current level's tendency towards white
            while killing NPCs and so on towards black. White tendency opens up
            previously unaccessable areas and generaly makes your journey
            easier. Black makes enemies stronger, adds additional enemies and so
            on. Here's the catch: dying as a human form also shifts tendency
            towards black and this can be a huge problem if you're already
            struggling with the game. The trick is to first get the Cling Ring from level 1-1. Normally when you die and turn into a soul
            form, your max health is halved. This ring only makes it dropby 25%.
            Additional bonus to being in soul form is that your footsteps are
            more silent, reducing enemy aggro range. After getting the ring and
            returning to Nexus, climb stairs up high, jump down and die. That
            way you can start the next level in soul form and don't have to
            worry about shifting tendency towards black by dying.
          </p>
          <h4 class="my-4">Beginning:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">When you begin you get to choose your class and make your own character. If you prefer melee, the Knight might be the best 
            for it's sturdy armor, shield etc. Royal is also really good, if you wish to go with magic. Which especially in this game is kinda overpowered and trivializes 
            many fights.
            You'll then go through a tutorial level, not much to mention there. After that you'll be able to choose your own path. The recommended path for beginners starts 
            something like 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1. That should get you going.
          </p>
          <h4>Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>Thief Ring can be found from level 1-1. It greatly reduces enemy aggro range and makes many areas (and even bosses) a lot easier. Use it with Cling Ring, 
              stay in soul form and further lower the sound of your steps.</li>
              <li>It's not a bad idea to grab a bow, upgrade it and use your spare souls on arrows. If you actually get really stuck, quite many of the bosses can be cheesed with bow.</li>
            <li>Struggling? Magic Build is your answer. Magic is pretty overpowered in many of the Souls games, but here it is even more so.</li>
            <li>You can find Dragon Longsword from level 2-2. One of the best weapons in the game.</li>

            Demon's Souls was maybe the game that started it all, but this is
            the game that made the genre widely known.

          <h4 class="my-4">General tips:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            <u>Souls and Dying:</u><br />
            You will die a lot. But don't let that discourage you. It is part of
            the learning experience. In Dark Souls when you kill something you
            get souls and when you die, you turn into a hollow and drop your
            souls. You get only one chance to get back to the point of your
            death and collect them. And you definetly want to, souls are the
            game's form of currency, used to level up your character, shop items
            etc. Also when you die, you become hollow. When in hollow form, you
            are unable to summon help. On the other hand, you also cannot be
            invaded by hostile NPCs or players.
            <br /><br />
            <u>Bonfires:</u><br />
            Bonfires are your friend. They heal you up, you can use them to
            level up, they refill your healing Estus Flasks and so on. But keep
            in mind, they also respawn every enemy.
            <u>Humanity:</u><br />
            The number top left represents how much liquid humanities you have.
            It can be increased by using consumable called Humanity, or killing
            certain enemies and bosses. Using humanity heals great deal of
            health. It is also used at bonfires to restore your human form if
            hollowed. It can also be used to kindle bonfires. Kindling a bonfire
            increases the amount of Estus Flasks granted to you when resting
            there.
          </p>
          <h4 class="my-4">Beginning:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            Choosing a character class is totally up to you. You will be able to
            change your build by leveling up later. Starting gift is also up to
            you. (Just... don't take binoculars.) Master Key is a double edged
            sword. It allows you to access certain later areas and good loot
            very early on. It also lets you skip certain hard areas. However as
            a beginner it might get you lost really bad.
          </p>
          <h4>Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>
              If you decide to go early through the Graveyard to the Catacombs
              in hopes of good loot, fine, but whatever you do, DO NOT take any
              bonfires besides the first one there. The way out is really hard,
              almost to the point where it's almost easier to restart the whole
              game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep your equipment load low. The lower it is, the faster your
              roll is, fastest being when load is under 25%. But under 50% is
              already really good. While armor do offer protection, it is much
              less so than in many other games.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use your souls. Idea of saving the currency for some big purchase
              may be tempting, but the risk of dying and losing all is ever
              constant. So if you have enough to level up or upgrade your weapon
              - do it. Not quite? Spend it on arrows, healing items etc.
              Stronger enemies eventually will yield more souls and you will get
              to buy what you want.

            elements (such as powerstancing weapons) to the series and the PVP

            Killing enemies yield souls (currency used for level upping,
            shopping etc.). However when you die you become hollow and drop the
            souls. You get only one chance to get back to that point and collect
            them or they'll be lost forever. Also your max health drops every
            time you die. When hollow you are unable to summon NPCs or other
            players for help. Unlike in the first game, this time it won't
            prevent others from incading you!<br /><br />
            <u>Bonfires:</u><br />
            Bonfires are your friend. They heal you up, you can use them to

            Once you complete the tutorial area (and may have noticed you don't
            need to fight every enemy) you arrive in Majula. This is the central
            hub of the game and a rare occasion of safety. Enjoy it. From here
            on you have pretty much two viable routes to progress: Forest of the
            Fallen Giants and Heide's Tower of Flame. I'd recommend starting
            with the former. <br />
          </p>
          <h4>Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>
              In central hub Majula, don't join the Company of Champions
              covenant. It'll make enemies stronger and game generally harder.
            </li>
            <li>
              In bottom of the Forest of the Fallen Giants, there is a cave with
              fire salamander. From a left side room in the cave you can find a
              Fire Longsword. It's a great early game weapon which will carry
              you far.
            </li>
            <li>
              Return Estus Flask Shards to Emerald Herald in Majula and burn
              Sublime Bone Dusts at the bonfires. Both improve your healing
              Estus Flask, former the amount you carry, latter the healing
              potency.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Forest of the Fallen Giants, near the first bonfire, you can
              find Merchant Hag Melentia. She sells you Lenigrast's Key, which
              opens the door for the Blacksmith in Majula. Blacksmith sells
              items and repairs broken equipment, but more importantly he
              upgrades your weapons and gear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always exhaust dialogue to the point of repeating themselves when
              talking to NPCs. They sometimes give you handy items, or may start
              a side quest.
            </li>
            <li>
              From the very beginning focus on leveling up your ADP until your
              Agility is somewhere around 100 points. This makes healing
              animation slightly faster, but what you really want - and the game
              doesn't tell - is the invicibility frames (or i-frames) it
              provides. If you plan to dodge attacks instead of blocking, this
              makes your life so much easier. Of course you want to level up
              other attributes as well, so don't try to level it all the way up
              straight away.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are many items (ex. Soul of a Hero, Soul of a Lost Undead
              etc.) which provide you with extra souls. Don't use them until you
              need them. You don't want to risk dying and losing them. Bosses
              also give you special kind of souls. You can use them, but it's
              best to save them. They can be later used for crafting special
              kind of items.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep equipment load low (unless you're going for tank build) for
              faster roll. Armor doesn't make THAT big of a difference anyway.
              On the same note, while leveling up attributes that scale with
              weapons you use is important, even more so you should focus on
              upgrading your weapons at the Blacksmith.

            With it's Bloodborne inspired fast-paced action, aesthetics and
            references to the first Dark Souls, many consider this to be the

            <u>Starting Class:</u><br />
            Like always the character class is up to you. Knight is generally a
            good choice because of high-hitting weapon, good armor and 100%
            physical blocking shield. However, Mercenary is intriguing choice
            due to one small little thing: Sellsword Twinblades as starting
            weapon. It's one of the most overpowered PvE weapons in the game.
            You can also acquire it later though.
            <br /><br />
            Now, you'll face your mandatory first boss very early on and before
            a chance to level up. This is the first wall for many new players
            and can be frustrating. This boss is all about teaching you the
            essential mechanics of the combat: parry, blocking, dodging. Couple
            things to note: you can start dealing damage to him even before his
            health bar is visible. Keeping your shield up and strafing around
            him to your right makes most of his attacks miss. Also viable tactic
            is to keep your distance. Observe and learn his attacks. There's
            guaranteed to be at least some that are easily read and dodged.
            Focus on dodging those and use the following opening to attack.
            Rinse and repeat. On his seconds phase (yes, you read right) he
            becomes faster and more intimidating but the same tactics still
            work.

            It's time for some Victorian Gothic Lovecraftian horror! Dark Souls
            taught players to be calculative, shield up and take encounters calm
            and easy. Along came Bloodborne and threw all that out of the
            window. Now we get fast and aggressive.
          </em>
          <h4 class="my-4">General tips:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            The risk-reward in combat is a very delicately balanced mechanic.
            When you take damage, you have brief moment to attack the enemy.
            Each succesful hit regains little bit of your lost health back! So
            it pays to be aggressive and fast, but getting too greedy here may
            also get you killed fast.
          </p>
          <h4 class="my-4">Beginning:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            You'll quickly notice that you'll start without a weapon. Once you
            die (or reach the first Lamp) you'll be taken to the Hunter's Dream
            - the central hub of the game - where you get to choose your weapon.
            If you want the most overpowered, good all around, high
            damage-per-second weapon, the Saw Cleaver is the way to go.
          </p>
          <h4>Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>
              Don't treat your gun as a way to do damage: it's purpose is to
              parry enemy attacks and open them for a Visceral Attack.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep your eyes open for shortcuts, gates and doors you can open.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is one shield in the game - and it's completely useless.
              Don't bother.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each weapon is a trick weapon with two different modes you can
              switch between by pressing L1. It changes attacks, range and speed
              radically. Better learn to use both. They can even be chained as a
              combo.
            </li>
            <li>
              To unlock leveling up, you need Insight level of at least 1.
              Easiest way to get there, is to find an optional first level boss,
              Cleric Beast, and confront it. You don't need to win, just trigger
              the encounter.

            Welcome to the Sengoku Period! After 5 games, From Software decided
            to radically change the formula and freshen up the series.
          </em>
          <h4 class="my-4">General tips:</h4>
          <p class="lead my-4">
            This game differs a lot from the traditional Souls formula. For some
            it is the absolute hardest, for some easiest. This time farming
            souls and leveling up isn't an option. You can farm and learn new
            skills, but attack power is only increased by beating bosses, while
            increasing max health is increased by collecting Prayer Beads (it
            takes 4 to upgrade). You get Prayer Beads mostly by - you guessed it
            - defeating difficult mini bosses.
            <br />
            <br />
            <u>Movement and Combat:</u>
            <br />
            The movement and approach to areas is now much more free compared to
            the previous titles and sneaking is totally a viable option. Since
            upgrading your stats and powering through enemies is not an option
            this time, you are forced to learn the actual combat. It revolves
            around parrying. Attacking and parrying enemy attacks raises their
            posture gauge and eventually opens them for a kill blow. When enemy
            is blocking and eventually parries your attack, you can hear very
            specific different kind of cling sound. Get ready now to deflect one
            of their attacks. Combat in Sekiro is almost like a dance,
            constantly going back and forth.<br /><br />
            <u>Prosthetic Tools:</u>
            <br />
            This time instead of different kind of weapons you are stuck with your trusted katana. However, there are many Prosthetic Tools you can find and upgrade 
            in different kind of ways. These Tools include such as Shurikens, Spear, Firecrackers etc. These bring more tactical element to the encounters, especially 
            with the bosses. Different kind of enemies have different weaknesses, for example: enemies with red eyes fear fire while Firecrackers are excellent against 
            beasts.
          </p>
          <h4>Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>
              Most bosses and minibosses have two health bars. Many times taking
              the sneaky approach may allow you to start the fight with a death
              blow, making the fight easier.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do NOT spam deflect. Window for parrying is fairly generous 30
              frames (0.5 seconds). However, if you spam it, each unsuccesful
              attempt narrows the window.
            </li>
            <li>
              This time once you fie you can resurrect yourself once (later
              multiple times.) Use this as a tactical advance, since it usually
              de-aggros enemies giving you back the element of surprise. It also
              can be used to escape. Be careful though, as enemies' posture
              gauge also lowers the longer you wait.
            </li>
            <li>
              Red Kanji above enemy's head indicates an unblockable attack is
              incoming. Get ready to dodge thrust attacks, or jump over and
              stomp on their head if they sweep.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ability you should prioritize buying as soon as possible: Mikiri
              Counter. It allows you to deflect Red Kanji thrust attacks while
              dealing huge amount of posture damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other important abilities:
              <br />
              Breath of Life: Light - recovers healt upon deathblows, Grappling
              Hook Attack, Ascending Carp and Descending Carp - both increase
              posture damage dealt.

            <p class="lead my-4"><u>Sites of Grace:</u>
            <br>Sites of Grace are this games form of checkpoint. At them you can trade your <em>runes</em> (got from enemies etc.) into levels and do other kinds of useful activities. 
          Some of them also emit a dim string of light. They usually lead to places affiliated with main quests. There is also <em>Stakes of Marika</em> close to bosses and 
        important locations. When dying, the game present you with an option to continue from there, or respawn at the last Site of Grace visited.</p>

          <h4 class="my-4">Misc:</h4>
          <ul class="lead my-4">
            <li>
              To fill in the missing pieces of your map, you need to find the actual map of each corresponding area. They are found from small obelisk kind of structures, which 
              are actually drawn in the map.
            </li>
            <li>When you reach the first merchant, it is highly recommended to prioritize buying the crafting kit immediately. Do not underestimate the value of being able to craft poison cures, arrows etc. on the go.</li>
            <li>Just because a boss resides the starting area, it doesn't mean they're supposed be tackled early on.</li>
            <li>Do not spam dodge roll, be meticulous. Enemies in this game have cleverly delayed tracking attacks and they will catch and punish you.</li>
            <li>One of the new mechanics is guard counters (pressin heavy attack right adter blocking an attack), they are really useful for fast countering, dealing great damage and possibly stunning the enemy.</li>
            <li>
              To the East from the starting location is the Agheel Lake. From the Northern part of it you can find Limgrave Tunnels, which offers a lot of early game Smithing 
              Stones for upgrading weapon.
            </li>
            <li>It's not bad idea to make your build so you are prepared to use variety of weapons (dex, str etc.), because this time - more than ever before - you will be 
              facing great variety of enemies with different weaknesses. 
              So it's a good idea to have some sort of slashing, long-range and striking weapon at hand at all the times.</li>
            <li>If you are up for a challenge, you can find and enter Forlorn Hound Evergaol, South from the Agheel Lake. You'll encounter a strong enemy, but if you manage to beat him, 
              you'll be rewarded with a Bloodhound's Fang, a special Str/Dex scaling weapon, which also causes a bleed build-up. It will melt through many of the early game enemies 
              and is still viable later with upgrading.
            </li>
            <li>You get your trustworthy horse early on. Besides faster travel between locations, mounted combat (hit-and-run) can trivialize many of the 
              overworld mini bosses.
            </li>
            <li>Once you have explored the starting area (which will take hours) and, after your first real boss, you arrive at the gates of the Stormveil Castle. 
              Especially if you've been struggling, this might be a good moment to take a little bit bigger detour and travel to the Southern part of the map. There lies 
              Weeping Peninsula. Lots of good gear and dungeons to clear.
            </li>
            <li>If you happen to stumble upon some Rune Arcs, save them for later. They are one time use, last only until you die, and they require you to first find <em>something</em> to really benefit you.</li>
