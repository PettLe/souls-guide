This is a small passion project to keep me sane and motivated during working on a bigger and longer project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

It also provides me with a chance to create something completely own, instead of following a course with pre-determined goals.
I want to keep this fairly simple and practice the basics I may have forgotten.

Still there's couple new things I want to dabble with:

- Bootstrap 5
- Responsive web design

JavaScript file is mostly for Firebase hosting configs.

I found fairly clever way to receive feedback. I didn't want to clutter my e-mail etc., so I connected feedback form to firestore. Now all feedbacks go there. It was little bit harder than I expected since it's been few weeks since I've practiced firestore last time. So it was welcome practice.

In the end the project was easy to breeze through. It turned out to be what I wanted, and I learned new things. Now all is left is to take my time and add the actual content.
Happy how easy it was to make the whole thing responsive.
