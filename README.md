This is a small passion project to keep me sane and motivated during working on a bigger and longer project for The Odin Project.

It also provides me with a chance to create something completely own, instead of following a course with pre-determined goals.
I want to keep this fairly simple and practice the basics I may have forgotten.

Still there's couple new things I want to dabble with:

- Bootstrap 5
- Responsive web design

I did initially add a JavaScript file, but there's a chance I will complete the project without using it!
